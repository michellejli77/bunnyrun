Bunny Run

Description: Bunny Run is an endless arcade game similar to Crossy Road. 
A bunny has to navigate itself across platforms by swerving traffic,
crossing rivers, and avoiding lava. However, unlike Crossy Road, 
there is a two-player mode, where the bunny races against an evil bunny 
controlled by a second player or by the computer. If the evil bunny
gets too far ahead, the evil bunny wins.

How to run the project: There are no additional data/source files; simply run
