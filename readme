Bunny Run

Description: Bunny Run is an endless arcade game similar to Crossy Road. 
A bunny has to navigate across platforms by swerving traffic,
crossing rivers, and avoiding lava. However, unlike Crossy Road, 
there is a two-player mode, where the bunny races against an evil bunny 
controlled by a second player or by the computer. If the evil bunny
gets too far ahead, the evil bunny wins.

How to run the project: Download the music files from tinyurl.com/bunnymusic, 
and then move the music folder into the bunnyrun directory. Then, run main.py 
to play the game!

Libraries: Other than cmu_112_graphics (Tkinter), my project uses pygame. It 
can be installed by running this command in the terminal: pip install pygame.

Shortcut Commands: All the ways to change game preferences are shown
on the game screen.
